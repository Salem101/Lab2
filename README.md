Part 1: 


  A) File name: ContactList.java
  
    Used FileReader & BufferedReader to read the file. 
    Created ArrayLists for the columns that we want to read in. 
    Used a while loop- while bufferedReader hasNext and is not null then add to list. 
    Used FileWriter & PrintWriter to display output of alphabetized list of names. 
    
  
  B) File name: TemperatureConverter.java
  
    Used java to create a temperature converter to calculate from Farenheit to Celsius. 
    Used scanner to get input from user. 
    Asked user if wanted to convert from C to F or F to C. 
    Then used if statement when they answered. 
    Used else statement to output: input was invalid. 
    
    
  C) File name: API request
  
    Used Hoppscotch (a.k.a) postwoman to get the content of a GET request from Nasa's NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service). 
     I picked the date I wanted an sent request. I copied the content and put in the file.
