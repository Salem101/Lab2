Which programming languages did you use for each of these problems? 
  I used Java for the first 2 questions and used Hoppscotch and an HTTP request for the last question. 
  
  
Why did you choose the particular language? 
  It's the most previous language that I learned which I am most familiar with. 
  
Was there anything difficult or easy about using that language for solving the problems? 
  For the first 2 questions Java was pretty straightforward. 
  However, for the last question, I wasn't sure if I fully understood the question. I used Hoppscotch but wasn't sure if you wanted us to create a new program for the request. 
  
  
If you had to solve the problem again, would you choose a different language? 
  Yes, I'd probably use JavaScript to make it into a webpage with a user interface. 
  Otherwise, everything was the same.
